### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper interfaces
- **State management**: Uses React hooks (useState, useCallback) for optimal performance
- **Clean code**: Modular component structure with separation of concerns
- **Accessibility**: Proper button states, disabled attributes, and semantic HTML

## Code Structure

### Main Component: `/src/app/cart/page.tsx`

- Handles quantity changes with optimized callbacks
- Calculates totals dynamically
- Renders both ticket selection and cart sections

### Styling: `/src/app/cart/styles.module.css`

- CSS modules for scoped styling
- Responsive breakpoints at 991px and 640px
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Keyframe animations for enhanced UX

### Navigation Integration

- Added to demo navigation component
- Added to main homepage as featured component
- Accessible via `/cart` route

## Key Features

### Reactive State Management

```typescript
const [tickets, setTickets] = useState<TicketType[]>([
  { id: 1, name: "NiÃ±os (Hasta 14 aÃ±os)", price: 10000, quantity: 1 },
  { id: 2, name: "Adultos", price: 15000, quantity: 2 },
  { id: 3, name: "Adulto mayor", price: 6000, quantity: 0 },
]);
```

### Dynamic Total Calculation

```typescript
const cartItems: CartItem[] = tickets.filter((ticket) => ticket.quantity > 0);
const total = cartItems.reduce(
  (sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity,
  0,
);
```

### Responsive Quantity Controls

- Plus/minus buttons with proper disabled states
- Visual feedback on interaction
- Prevents negative quantities

### Smart UI States

- Continue button disabled when cart is empty
- Empty cart message when no tickets selected
- Smooth animations for state changes

## Browser Compatibility

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Touch-friendly interface for mobile devices

## Performance Optimizations

- useCallback for quantity change handlers
- Minimal re-renders with proper React patterns
- CSS animations using transform for optimal performance
- Efficient state updates with functional updates

This implementation provides a production-ready, fully reactive ticket purchasing system that exactly matches the provided design while offering excellent user experience and performance.
